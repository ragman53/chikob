As an anthropologist who codes and dances, I explore the complex entanglements of culture, technology, and the body. My work involves translating deep field insights into interactive digital experiences and robust software applications, and using this practice as a philosophical experiment to forge more responsive ethics for our deeply entangled world of human and non-human actors.

        - Engaged in over a decade of deep, embodied research into the Chicago Footwork dance style, becoming one of the key practitioners in the Japanese club scene.
        - Analyzed and performed complex rhythmic structures (160BPM) and spatial dynamics within a competitive, improvisational context.
        - Actively contributed to the Japanese Chicago Juke/Footwork scene as a music producer, creating tracks to foster community growth and cultural evolution.

        ### Ethnographic Researcher | Okinawa Vegan Movement Project
        *Chiba, Japan | 2021 - 2023*
        - Conducted a two-year ethnographic study in Okinawa, analyzing the fluid practices and ideologies of local veganism.
        - Managed long-term fieldwork, including participant observation, in-depth interviews, and qualitative data analysis.
        - Developed the original theoretical concepts of "Porous Sphere" and "Organic Survival" to explain complex social entanglements.
        - Authored a 90-page thesis, demonstrating advanced research, analytical, and writing capabilities.

        ### Independent Developer & Designer | Personal Projects
        *Tokyo, Japan | 2023 - Present*
        - Led the entire lifecycle of cross-platform desktop applications (e.g., GoiDev) from conception to deployment, using a modern stack including Rust, Tauri, and Svelte.
        - Architected and built complex, interactive web experiences (e.g., this portfolio) leveraging Astro, Three.js, and advanced CSS techniques.
        - Practiced agile, self-directed project management, creative problem-solving, and continuous learning of new technologies.

        ### Field Researcher (Participant-Observer) | Gig Economy & Urban Space
        *Tokyo, Japan | 2022 - Present*
        - Engaged in participant observation within Tokyo's gig economy, gaining firsthand insights into urban logistics, platform-labor dynamics, and human-computer interaction in real-world conditions.
        - Mastered complex urban navigation and time-sensitive logistical problem-solving under high-pressure environments.

        ## Education

        ### Master of Arts, Cultural Anthropology | Chiba University
        *Chiba, Japan | 2021 - 2023*
        - Thesis: "Vegan Assertiveness for Sustainable Lives: Communication Techniques in the Context of the Vegan Movement in Okinawa"
        
        > Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Okinawa, this thesis examines the fluid practices and ideologies of local veganism. It challenges the notion that veganism can be defined by a fixed group or ideology, arguing instead that clear boundaries cannot be drawn around its practitioners or their diverse activities. The study investigates how seemingly scattered actions—from food preparation to engagement in various social movements—collectively constitute veganism in Okinawa. It reveals that for practitioners, social issues are interconnected, and a range of bodily experiences shapes their ethical commitments. The analysis provides a materialistic answer through the concept of "porosity," showing how practices intertwine via the life cycles of material objects. The thesis culminates in the concept of "Organic Survival," a reconceptualization of sustainability that describes an ideal, self-sufficient state for the body, society, and environment. Ultimately, it concludes that the desire to avoid "Hunger"—a multi-layered threat to this organic survival—is the driving force that connects diverse social movements and ethical practices, transcending conventional boundaries.

        ## Projects

        - **[My Portfolio](https://github.com/ragman53/chikob):** A Brutalist-Inspired Digital Identity
        
          Developed a portfolio site using Astro that serves as a material reflection of my creative philosophy. The Brutalist-inspired design was chosen to strip away superficial decoration, focusing on structural honesty and the raw beauty of the content. The site leverages Astro's View Transitions to create a seamless, SPA-like user experience with custom CSS animations, including a unique 3D page-flip effect. The homepage features a high-performance, interactive particle system built with Three.js (WebGL) that deconstructs an SVG logo in real-time, exploring themes of deconstruction and reassembly central to my analytical approach.

        - **[GoiDev](https://github.com/ragman53/GoiDev)**: PDF Language Learning Environment
        
          Spearheaded the development of a cross-platform desktop application using Rust, Tauri, and Svelte, designed to enhance language acquisition through contextual reading. Grounded in the anthropological insight that language is best learned through immersion, the application allows users to instantly look up word definitions within a PDF, which are then fetched from an API and can be added to a personal vocabulary database (SQLite). The project features a custom PDF renderer and a minimalist, Bauhaus-inspired UI, prioritizing an efficient, focused learning experience that respects the user's cognitive flow.
