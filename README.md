# My Portfolio Website with Astro & Three.js
This is a personal portfolio website built with a brutalist-inspired aesthetic, leveraging the power of modern web technologies like Astro, Three.js, and CSS animations. The project focuses on creating a unique, performant, and highly interactive user experience.

## ‚ú® Features
- Seamless Page Transitions: Utilizes Astro's View Transitions API to create smooth, app-like navigation without full page reloads.
- Dynamic Theming: Each page section (/idea, /craft, etc.) features its own unique color scheme, which is applied globally and transitions smoothly between pages.
- Custom Animations:
- A unique 3D page-flip effect for content transitions.
- An interactive navigation bar where the active page title and menu items animate in and out on navigation.
- Interactive Particle Logo: The homepage features a high-performance, interactive logo built with Three.js (WebGL). The SVG logo is deconstructed into a particle system that reacts to the user's cursor movements in real-time.
- Infinite Marquee Banner: A seamlessly looping announcement banner at the bottom of the landing page, built with pure CSS animations.
- Type-Safe Content Management: Blog posts and articles are managed through Astro's Content Collections, using MDX for a rich authoring experience with type-safety provided by Zod schemas.
- Fully Responsive Design: The layout, typography, and interactive elements are designed to work flawlessly across all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
